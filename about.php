$html="<p>Hi.  I'm Jonathan Hollingsworth, a software developer turned project manager turning software developer.  After seven years running some pretty big
                development projects for a wide variety of industries, I just can't shake the technical geek inside of me.  I'm currently living in Leeds, UK with my fiancee
            and as yet, no dog.  We will be locating to Queenstown in New Zealand from September, 2013, where we hope a dog will adopt us and take us for long, 
            mountainous walks.</p>
            <p>As part of my software re-education, I've primarily been investigating Javascript/JQuery, PHP and Java.  I worked extensively with Javascript, pre-JQuery,
            as part of my post-University software development days.  PHP is very similar to the classic ASP that was the business logic behind many of our 
            web sites.  Java is new to me, beyond the odd University course, but I'm thoroughly enjoying getting stuck in.</p>
            <p>This blog will mainly cover code development, but some other job-related content may make an appearance from time to time.  The blog is self hosted and
                self developed.  Re-inventing the wheel is never a good thing, but writing it myself gives me the opportunity to use it as a test bed.</p>
