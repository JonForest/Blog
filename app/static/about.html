<p>Hi. I'm Jonathan Hollingsworth, a software developer turned project manager turned software developer. After seven
    years running some pretty big
    development projects for a wide variety of industries, I couldn't shake the technical geek inside of me.</p>
<p>I live in beautiful Queenstown, New Zealand, with my wife and a rescue dog we're tying to train to not hunt
    birds.  When not writing software, I'm a keen snowboarder, skier and hiker.</p>
<p>Development-wise, I love the compactness and elegance of Javascript - both on the client and with node.js. I also
    think PHP gets a raw deal from the rest of the programming community, and while it has its faults there is a reason
    it runs over 80% of websites.</p>
 <p>This blog will cover some coding, some professional development and some observations from the trenches.  Many of
     the articles are embryonic forms of content that will find its way into a book I'm writing:
     <b>The Secret to being a Great Developer</b>.</p>
